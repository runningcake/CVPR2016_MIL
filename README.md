## Description
You can refer to the original paper: [Hou_Patch-Based_Convolutional_Neural_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Hou_Patch-Based_Convolutional_Neural_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)  
This is an implementation for the part that trains a convolutional ceural cetwork in an EM fashion.
